Name: Human Cell Atlas

Description: "The Human Cell Atlas (HCA) is a collaborative community of
  international scientists. Our mission is to create comprehensive reference
  maps of all the cells in the human body as a basis for both understanding
  human health and diagnosing, monitoring, and treating disease. The HCA
  registry has more than one thousand member scientists from hundreds of
  institutions around the world. The project is steered and governed by an
  Organizing Committee, co-chaired by Aviv Regev and Sarah Teichmann."
